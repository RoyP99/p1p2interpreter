<h1>P1P2 Interpreter Domoticz</h1>

This is a standalone Python program to extract P1P2 messages from MQTT and send a translation back to MQTT to be used in Domoticz<br>
The P1P2 information will be written to the MQTT server using the great project from Arnold Niessen, [link](https://github.com/Arnold-n/P1P2MQTT)

Work in progress
